# React App Comparison

In this folder, I've organized two separate methods of creating React applications:

## Traditional Method:

1. Created using command : " npm create-react-app [app-name] ".
2. This method sets up a React application with the standard configuration provided by Create React App. It includes a comprehensive set of dependencies and takes relatively more time to initialize.

## Using Vite:

1. Created using command : " npm create vite@latest ".
2. Vite is a modern build tool that offers a streamlined development experience by leveraging native ES module imports. It is known for its fast startup time and efficient bundling process.

## Why Use Vite? 

- Vite is preferred over the traditional method because it avoids unnecessary dependencies and reduces initial setup time significantly.

**Each method is contained within its respective folder, accompanied by a README file detailing setup and  usage instructions specific to that approach. This structure allows for a direct comparison of the two methods for creating React applications.**
